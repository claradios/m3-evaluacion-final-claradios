This is an app where you can find characters from the Netflix show, Rick and Morty. You just need to type into the text input behind the main title (Rick and Morty fasionable logo). There you go, only the characters that match what you are typing will appear on screen. Moreover you can access to detailed info of each character by clicking on it. There is a go back link that will lead you to the main page after checking the detailed character page.
